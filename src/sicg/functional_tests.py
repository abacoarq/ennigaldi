        # Core, Spectrum, etc.), which governs how much information
        # will be filled by the user.

    # if requested (or automatically?)

    # this exported file ought to be pushed to a specific branch
    # of a git repository. This might help:

    # (B) List view of existing objects is invoked from link on home page.
    # It is displayed as a table or rendered as such by means of div and css.

    # The list can be reordered according to several criteria, at least:
    # title, agent, accession number.
